- The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard that displays belly button bacteria data for each volunteer using a dropdown menu where the user can 
select a volunteer and that test subject's information will then populate the dashboard. The dashboard will contain demographic info, belly button washing 
frequency, the top 10 most common cultures found inside the volunteer's navel and the frequencies of all of the cultures found.
